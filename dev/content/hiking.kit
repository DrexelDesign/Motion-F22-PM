                <h1>Pyramid Peak</h1>
                <p>Starting at scenic Maroon Lake, this hike ambles through the forest below the majestic Maroon Bells before turning up a steep trail. After some switchbacks, it pops out into a large boulder field below the rocky wall of Pyramid's north face. After a steep headwall hike, it starts to get fun. Hikers can enjoy incredible views of the Maroon Bells, Capitol Peak, and Snowmass Mountain while scrambling the final 1,000 vertical feet to the summit.</p>
